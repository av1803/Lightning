# Lightning
Lightning is an automated retail checkout system, built using Python, Flask and Selenium, which purchases exclusive products the moment they are stocked

The system is completely autonomous; the multiple processes all work together by means of a central server

The central server has the ability to initiate the buying process if it detects that an item is in stock

Some of the processes include:
* Website scalping
* Social media listening
* Registration
* Proxy setup
* Checking out/Buying items
