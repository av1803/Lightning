# Lightning
Lightning is an automated retail checkout system, built using Python, Flask and Selenium, which purchases exclusive products the moment they are stocked

The system is completely autonomous, the multiple processes all work together by means of a central server

The central server has the ability to initiate the buying process if it detects that an item is in stock

Some of the processes include:
* Website scalping
* Social media listening
* Registration
* Proxy setup
* Buying
